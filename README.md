# MCTS Visualizer
This is a simple visualizer for the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm.
The front end is written in VueJS and the algorithm is written in TypeScript.

## What is MCTS?
MCTS is a heuristic search algorithm that is used in decision processes. It is used in games like Go, Chess, and Shogi.   
The algorithm is based on the Monte Carlo method, which is a statistical method that uses random sampling to solve problems.  
For more information, you can check the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search).
## What is this project?
I used MCTS in one of my school projects, and I wanted to visualize how the algorithm works. So I created this simple visualizer.  
The idea come from [here](https://github.com/vgarciasc/mcts-viz).
